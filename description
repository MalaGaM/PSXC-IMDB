This script will (like a great deal of other scripts) read the imdb-url in a
.nfo and paste parts of what it finds in the IRC channel. So, what's different
with this script?
Well, unlike the others, this do not require tcl or perl in able to work, but it
do support some external scripts to accomodate for pre-support and speedier irc-
channel output. In it's basic form, it's a single, small(?) file.
